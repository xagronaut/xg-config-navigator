# Xg Config Navigator

## Overview

This is a prototype tool that uses Cytoscape.js to visualize configuration data sourced from an Excel spreadsheet.

## Road map

Future enhancements may include:

* Flexible data sources (Neo4j, JSON, API calls, etc.)
* Real-time updates to the visualization based on changes to data sources or other events
* Save an image of the generated visualization that is larger than the visible canvas area (i.e., get around canvas "clipping" during image export)
* Save multiple snapshots and restore them at any time in the future (from a list)

## Credits

This project uses components from the following libraries:

* Angular.js
* jQuery, jQuery Layout
* Bootstrap
* d3.js (color scheme generation)
* Cytoscape.js
* XLSX.js
* jszip.js
* Icons from Material Design (Google)
